            <section id="introduction">
                <p>For this section, I spent time actually using sessions.ca the way a customer would—browsing products, switching between stores, trying to find locations. I wanted to understand the friction points that might be contributing to the -17.69% traffic decline.</p>

                <p>Here are the four issues that stood out, prioritized by business impact.</p>
            </section>

            <hr>

            <!-- Issue 1: Store Switching -->
            <section id="friction-points">
                <h2>1. Store Switching Creates Cart Abandonment Risk</h2>

                <h3>How I discovered this:</h3>

                <p>I was browsing products at the North York location, added a few items to my cart, then noticed I was closer to the Aurora location. When I tried to switch stores, a modal message appeared: "You can still switch stores at any time!"</p>

                <p>The phrasing suggests the cart system requires location selection, which makes sense for inventory management. But here's the problem: based on common e-commerce patterns, switching stores likely clears the cart. I couldn't test this fully without creating an account, but the UX pattern is a red flag.</p>

                <h3>Why this matters:</h3>

                <p>Industry research shows cart abandonment increases by 20-30% when users must restart their shopping journey. For a business with 45+ locations and varying inventory, customers naturally want to compare availability between nearby stores. Forcing them to start over penalizes comparison shopping.</p>

                <p>I've seen this pattern in multi-location retail before, and it always hurts conversion rates.</p>

                <h3>How I would fix this:</h3>

                <p>If I were your Digital Marketing Manager, I'd work with your dev team to implement a <strong>persistent cart with real-time availability checking</strong>:</p>

                <pre><code>USER EXPERIENCE FLOW:

Current store: North York
Cart: 5 items ($127.50)

User clicks: "Switch to Aurora location"

                <div class="concept-box">
                    <h4>Technical implementation:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Store cart data in session/database (not location-dependent)</li>
                        <li>Real-time inventory API check when switching locations</li>
                        <li>"Saved for Later" feature for unavailable items</li>
                        <li>Clear communication about what transfers</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Business impact:</h3>

                <p>Even a 5% reduction in cart abandonment across 273.2K monthly visits could mean significant revenue recovery. Let's say 10% of visitors add to cart, and we reduce abandonment by 5%:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>27,320 add-to-cart events per month</li>
                    <li>5% abandonment reduction = 1,366 additional completed transactions annually</li>
                    <li>At $75 average order value = <strong>$102,450 annual revenue recovery</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This would be a <strong>Month 2 priority</strong> for me—not immediate because it requires dev work, but high-value once implemented.</p>

            <!-- Issue 2: Homepage CTAs -->
            <section id="homepage-ctas">
                <h2>2. Homepage Lacks Clear Primary Action</h2>

                <h3>What I observed:</h3>

                <p>When I landed on the homepage, I saw "Your next session starts here"—great brand messaging, very on-point. But then I paused. What am I supposed to do next?</p>

                <p>The navigation has "Shop," "Locations," "Rewards," but none of these are emphasized as the primary action. For a new visitor, there's no clear path to conversion. I had to think about where to click.</p>

                <p>In e-commerce, decision paralysis kills conversion rates. According to UX research, lack of clear CTAs increases bounce rate by 15-25%.</p>

                <h3>Competitive comparison:</h3>

                <p>I checked your competitors to see how they handle this:</p>

                <div class="important-points">
                    <h4>Canna Cabana:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prominent "Shop Now" button (orange, above fold)</li>
                        <li>"Find a Store" with location search</li>
                        <li>"Delivery" option clearly visible</li>
                        <li>Three CTAs competing for attention, but clear hierarchy</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="important-points">
                    <h4>Tokyo Smoke:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Shop Cannabis" primary CTA (large, centered)</li>
                        <li>"Find a Store" secondary (smaller but visible)</li>
                        <li>"Learn More" tertiary (education-first positioning)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Both competitors make it immediately obvious what you should do next. Sessions doesn't.</p>

                <h3>How I would fix this:</h3>

                <p>As your Digital Marketing Manager, I'd redesign the hero section with a <strong>dual-CTA hierarchy</strong>:</p>

                <pre><code>HERO SECTION REDESIGN:

                    <h4>Why this structure works:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Primary CTA: "Find Your Nearest Store"</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Addresses the most common search intent: "cannabis near me"</li>
                                <li>Removes friction (no browsing required if you just want to visit)</li>
                                <li>Works for both first-timers and regulars</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Doesn't compete with primary action (different visual weight)</li>

                                <li>Reduces clicks to get to store information</li>
                                <li>Mobile-friendly (most traffic is mobile)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="revision-box">
                    <h4>Additional homepage enhancements I'd make:</h4>
                    <p>Below the hero section:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"Featured Deals"</strong> (drives urgency)</li>
                        <li><strong>"New Arrivals" carousel</strong> (product discovery)</li>
                        <li><strong>Social proof:</strong> "Join 10,000+ Sessions Rewards members"</li>
                        <li><strong>Educational content teasers</strong> (if/when blog launches)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Expected impact:</h3>

                <p>Clear CTAs can increase engagement by 15-25%. With 273.2K monthly visits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>20% engagement improvement = 54,640 more engaged sessions</li>
                    <li>At 8% conversion rate = 4,371 additional conversions annually</li>
                    <li>At $75 AOV = <strong>$327,825 annual revenue improvement</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This would be a <strong>Week 2-3 priority</strong>—quick win that requires design work but no complex development.</p>

            <!-- Issue 3: Mobile Navigation -->
            <section id="mobile-navigation">
                <h2>3. Mobile Navigation Buries Product Categories</h2>

                <h3>Testing process:</h3>

                <p>I pulled up sessions.ca on my phone and tried to navigate to "Edibles." Here's what I had to do:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Tap hamburger menu (☰)</li>
                    <li>Tap "Shop" to expand submenu</li>
                    <li>Finally see product categories (Flower, Pre-rolls, Vapes, Edibles, Beverages)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>That's two taps to reach a primary product category. In mobile e-commerce, every extra tap costs conversions.</p>

                <h3>Why this is a problem:</h3>

                <p>According to Baymard Institute research, 33% of mobile e-commerce sites make this mistake. The issue compounds when you consider:</p>

                <div class="common-mistakes">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>60-70% of cannabis retail traffic is mobile</strong> (industry average)</li>
                        <li>Mobile users have less patience than desktop users</li>
                        <li>"Near me" searches are predominantly mobile</li>
                        <li>You're likely losing the most high-intent traffic</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>How I would fix this:</h3>

                <p>Restructure the mobile menu to expose product categories at the top level:</p>

                <pre><code>MOBILE NAVIGATION (NEW STRUCTURE):

☰ MENU
├── 🌿 Flower
├── 🚬 Pre-rolls
├── 💨 Vapes
├── 🍪 Edibles
├── 🥤 Beverages
├── ─────────────
├── 📍 Store Locator
├── 🎁 Rewards Program
├── 📖 About Us
└── 📞 Contact</code></pre>

                <div class="important-points">
                    <h4>Why this works:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One tap from menu to category (50% friction reduction)</li>
                        <li>Icons improve scannability (visual hierarchy)</li>
                        <li>High-intent categories prioritized (product discovery first)</li>
                        <li>Store locator remains prominent (location-driven business)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Technical implementation:</h3>

                <p>This is a theme-level change. I would:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check if current theme supports custom mobile menus (most modern themes do)</li>
                    <li>If not, use custom CSS to restructure on mobile breakpoints</li>
                    <li>Test on real devices (iPhone, Android, various screen sizes)</li>
                </ol>

                <pre><code>/* Example CSS for mobile menu restructure */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .main-menu .submenu-toggle {
    display: none; /* Remove "Shop" parent, show categories directly */
  }

  .product-categories {
    display: block;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }

  .product-categories li {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;
    padding: 15px;
    font-size: 16px;
  }
}</code></pre>

                <h3>Expected impact:</h3>

                <p>Reducing navigation friction by one tap can improve mobile conversions by 10-15%. With mobile representing 60-70% of traffic:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>163,920 monthly mobile visits (60% of 273.2K)</li>
                    <li>10% conversion improvement = 16,392 better mobile experiences</li>
                    <li>At 8% conversion = 1,311 additional monthly mobile conversions</li>
                    <li>At $75 AOV = <strong>$98,325 monthly = $1,179,900 annual</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This would be a <strong>Week 1 priority</strong>—it's a quick theme configuration change with massive impact on your largest traffic segment.</p>

                <h3>The pattern I see:</h3>

                <p>These pages feel template-driven, but the templates aren't being used consistently. Some locations have rich local content, others are bare-bones. This is a classic franchise execution problem—no standardized approach, so quality varies wildly.</p>

                <h3>Why this matters:</h3>

                <p>For customers, inconsistent pages create a disjointed brand experience. For SEO, incomplete pages underperform in local search rankings. And based on my research, your competitors have much more consistent, complete location pages.</p>

                <div class="common-mistakes">
                    <h4>What's missing from location pages:</h4>
                    <p>When I visit a location page, I want to know:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Is this location open right now?</strong> (hours prominently displayed)</li>
                        <li><strong>What products are popular here?</strong> (live inventory highlights)</li>
                        <li><strong>What deals are running?</strong> (location-specific promotions)</li>
                        <li><strong>What do other customers say?</strong> (reviews from THIS specific location)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Most of this information is either missing or buried below the fold.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>How I would fix this:</h3>

                <p>Create a <strong>standardized location page template</strong> with priority information architecture:</p>

                <pre><code>LOCATION PAGE TEMPLATE (NEW STRUCTURE):

                <div class="concept-box">
                    <h4>Franchise scalability:</h4>
                    <p>The key to making this work across 45+ locations is <strong>modular control</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sections 1-2:</strong> Corporate-managed (consistency across brand)</li>
                        <li><strong>Section 3:</strong> Franchisee content blocks (local flexibility)</li>
                        <li><strong>Section 4:</strong> Auto-populated (Google reviews API, map embed)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This balances brand consistency with local autonomy—something I know is critical in franchise operations.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Technical implementation:</h3>

                <p>As your Digital Marketing Manager, I would:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create WordPress page template (<code>template-location.php</code>)</li>
                    <li>Set up custom fields for franchisees to update (hours, phone, announcements)</li>
                    <li>Integrate Google My Business API for reviews display</li>
                    <li>Train franchisees on updating their sections (15-minute video)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Expected impact:</h3>

                <p>Better location page optimization means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved local SEO rankings</strong> (complete, unique content per location)</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced inbound calls</strong> (hours/info clearly displayed)</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher conversion</strong> (social proof visible, inventory highlights)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Standardized, optimized location pages could improve per-location traffic by 10-15%, which across 45 locations adds up fast.</p>
